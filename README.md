# Financial Risk Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning algorithms to conduct risk analysis for loan default prediction in the context of a consumer finance company. By analyzing historical loan application data, the goal is to identify patterns and factors indicating whether a client is likely to default on their loan payments. The insights gained from this analysis assist in minimizing financial losses while ensuring creditworthy applicants are not unfairly rejected.

## Project Details

### Tools Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn

### Algorithms Implemented
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Business Objectives

1. **Identify Patterns:**
   - Use EDA techniques to identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty in repaying loans through detailed analysis of application data.

2. **Determine Key Factors:**
   - Determine the key demographic, financial, and credit-related factors that influence loan default using machine learning models.

3. **Utilize Insights:**
   - Utilize insights gained from the analysis to inform portfolio management, risk assessment, and lending practices.

4. **Optimize Lending Decisions:**
   - Develop strategies to minimize financial losses due to loan defaults and optimize lending decisions.

## Key Questions Explored

1. **Educational and Employment Patterns:**
   - Are there specific educational or employment patterns associated with higher default risk?

2. **Client Profiles:**
   - Are there differences in the client profiles between those with payment difficulties and those without?

3. **Income to Debt Ratio:**
   - Calculate the income-to-debt ratio and explore its relationship with loan default probability.

4. **Income Distribution:**
   - What is the income distribution among loan applicants, and how does it influence loan amounts and approval rates?

5. **Impact of Loan Amount:**
   - How does the loan amount requested by clients compare to their income levels, and does it impact default rates?

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project aims to optimize lending decisions by gaining deep insights into the risk factors associated with loan defaults. The use of various machine learning algorithms and thorough data analysis helps in developing strategies that ensure responsible lending and risk mitigation.
